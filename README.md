# Pre-work - *Tipsy*

**Tipsy** is a tip calculator application for iOS.

Submitted by: **Kaitlyn Suzuki**

Time spent: **8** hours spent in total

## User Stories

The following **required** functionality is complete:

* [x] User can enter a bill amount, choose a tip percentage, and see the tip and total values.
* [x] User can select between tip percentages by tapping different values on the segmented control and the tip value is updated accordingly

The following **optional** features are implemented:

* [ ] UI animations
* [ ] Remembering the bill amount across app restarts (if <10mins)
* [ ] Using locale-specific currency and currency thousands separators.
* [x] Making sure the keyboard is always visible and the bill amount is always the first responder. This way the user doesn't have to tap anywhere to use this app. Just launch the app and start typing.

The following **additional** features are implemented:

- [x] Included a Setting screen for the user to input their own tip values and a button to reset to the default values.
- [x] Improved UI.
- [x] Calculates cost per individual depending on the size of the party.

## Notes

- It was a bit difficult getting used to connecting the elements of the storyboard to the logic itself in the swift files.
- I had some confusion dealing with the UserDefaults, but was able to make it work by looking through documentation and articles.
- I struggled a bit when trying to make a more aesthetically pleasing interface.
